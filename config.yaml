# Baseline average methylation per centromere.
# Adjusts height_perc_valley_threshold and prom_perc_valley_threshold based on avg methyl coverage relative to baseline.
# Will only increase thresholds and never reduce them.
# Reduces false positives in centromeres with low methylation relative to coverage.
# ex.
#   avg methyl coverage is 0.2
#   methyl_avg_baseline is 0.4
#   0.4 / 0.2 = 2
#   thresholds will be multiplied by 2
# Can be omitted.
